:fontawesome-brands-github: [ThreatPot Repository](https://github.com/khulnasoft/ThreatPot)

# Introduction

The project goal is to extract data of the attacks detected by a [TPOT](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce) or a cluster of them and to generate some feeds that can be used to prevent and detect attacks.

[Official announcement here](https://www.honeynet.org/2021/12/27/new-project-available-threatpot/).

## Public feeds

There are public feeds provided by The Honeynet Project in this site: threatpot.honeynet.org. [Example](https://threatpot.honeynet.org/api/feeds/log4j/all/recent.txt)

To check all the available feeds, Please refer to our [usage guide](https://khulnasoft.github.io/devsec-docs/ThreatPot/Usage/)

Please do not perform too many requests to extract feeds or you will be banned.

If you want to be updated regularly, please download the feeds only once every 10 minutes (this is the time between each internal update).
